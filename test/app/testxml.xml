  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, controlled (active comparator), randomized study of 8 weeks
      follow-up for the evaluation of the efficacy of extended release quetiapine (quetiapine XR)
      versus Sertraline in addition to previous mood stabilizer treatment (lithium or valproate at
      stable and clinically therapeutic blood levels) in the treatment of the adult bipolar
      depression. This multicentric study will be featured in two sites in Spain.
